## Conservative Strategy Integration

All workflows are designed to support the conservative Twitter outreach strategy:

### Rate Limiting
- Daily limits respect Twitter guidelines
- Conservative approach to API usage
- Automatic quota management
- Rate limit monitoring and alerts

### Lead Qualification
- Bot detection and filtering
- Quality lead identification
- Conservative engagement criteria
- Automated qualification testing

### Error Handling
- Graceful API error handling
- Rate limit error detection
- Automatic operation pausing
- Comprehensive error reporting

## Environment Configuration

### Required Secrets
```bash
# Twitter API Credentials
TWITTER_API_KEY=your_api_key
TWITTER_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET=your_access_secret
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=your_bearer_token

# Environment-specific variables
NODE_ENV=production
TWITTER_API_ENV=production
LOG_LEVEL=warn
CAMPAIGN_MODE=conservative
RATE_LIMIT_STRICT=true
```

### Environment Setup
1. **Staging Environment**: For testing and validation
2. **Production Environment**: For live operations
3. **Test Environment**: For automated testing

## Deployment Process

### Staging Deployment
1. CI workflow completes successfully
2. CD workflow validates deployment readiness
3. Staging environment deployment
4. Staging validation tests
5. Health checks
6. Deployment report generation

### Production Deployment
1. Staging deployment successful
2. Production environment validation
3. Production secret verification
4. Production deployment
5. Production health checks
6. Deployment verification
7. Monitoring setup

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Checks
- API connectivity monitoring
- Rate limit status tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Performance metrics
- System resource usage

### Reports Generated
- API Health Reports
- Rate Limit Reports
- Performance Reports
- System Health Reports
- Deployment Reports
- Test Reports

## Security Features

### Secret Management
- GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- Environment-specific secret validation
- Secret scanning in CI
- Secure deployment practices

### Security Scanning
- npm audit for vulnerabilities
- Secret detection in code
- Environment variable validation
- Security best practices enforcement

## Usage Instructions

### Manual Workflow Triggers

1. **Deploy to Specific Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Trigger deployment workflow
   # Select environment: staging/production
   # Optionally force deployment
   ```

2. **Test Specific Components:**
   ```bash
   # Trigger Twitter strategy tests
   # Select test mode: all/rate_limits/lead_qualification/outreach_sequences/api_validation
   ```

3. **Run Health Checks:**
   ```bash
   # Trigger monitoring workflow
   # Select check type: all/api_health/rate_limits/error_rates/performance
   ```

### Automated Triggers

- **Push to main**: Triggers CI â†’ CD pipeline
- **Pull requests**: Triggers CI validation
- **Scheduled runs**: Daily health checks and monitoring
- **File changes**: Targeted testing for specific components

## Best Practices
